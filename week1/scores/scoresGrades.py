'''
Create a program that prompts the user ten times for a test score between 60 and 100.
Each time a score is generated, your program should display what is the grade of that score.

Here is the grade table:

Score: 60 - 69; Grade - D
Score: 70 - 79; Grade - C
Score: 80 - 89; Grade - B
Score: 90 - 100; Grade - A
